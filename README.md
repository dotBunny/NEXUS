## Documentation

We've elected to utilize [Google Docs](http://nexus.dotbunny.com/) to house the documentation for the **NEXUS** Framework. This way it is easy to read, search and most importantly **author**.

*Let's not kid ourselves...* We are all a little lacking in documenting our work area, so this is our best bet at creating a spot to collate formalized documentation. Code documentation should still be present to mark up methods and other elements.
