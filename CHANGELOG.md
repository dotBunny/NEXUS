## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-01

### Fixes

- Resolves issues with `Shipping` build configuration (accidental reference to `FunctionalTesting` modules in `Core`)

### Known Issues

- The `NSamplesDisplayActor` is still based off of the `AFunctionalTest` which is part of `FunctionalTesting`, thus any usage of it will prevent a shipping build from completing.

### Added

- `NActorPools` *Generalized pooling system for Actors.*
- `NCore` *Functionality used by all NEXUS plugins in the framework.*
- `NDynamicReferences` *Method for referring to runtime Actors without knowing them.*
- `NFixers` *A collection of tools for fixing content in the Unreal Editor.*
- `NMaterialLibrary` *Library of Materials commonly used.*
- `NMultiplayer` *Functionality and tools that are useful when developing multiplayer games.*
- `NPicker` *Selection functionality for points and other items.*
- `NUI` *Components for creating a user interface based on UMG/Slate.*
